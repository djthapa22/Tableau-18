# Tableau-18: Module 18

**Overview**
Within this module I used the ETL methods to clean data provided by NYC/NJ bike data and used tableau to create meaningful visualitions. <br>

*<ins>ETL Steps:</ins>*
* <ins>Extract</ins> <br> I used the CSV file for March 2023 New Jersey Bike data to conduct analysis by creating the below metrics:
  * Derived distance traveled using the [formula](https://www.exceldemy.com/calculate-distance-between-two-gps-coordinates-excel/)
  * Dervied Start and End Days and times
  * Created number of hours rode
* <ins>Tranform</ins> <br> 
* <ins>Load</ins> <br> I used Tableau to conduct visualtions that dervied my three phenonmenons that are presented in 3 dashboards


# Phonomenon 1: Check Phenom 1 Dashboard! <br>
* Member & Rider Type: The data suggests the NJ bike market has more member users,(<b>~50K</b>), than casual riders. Along with Classic bikes being the most popular amongst a choice of docked, electric and classic bikes. 
  * The member user also tends to ride more distance than casual users (33K miles Vs ~10K miles)
  * Therefore: New Jersey's primary customer target should be member riders.

# Phenomenon 2:  Check Phen 2 Dashboard!<br> 
* Dispersion of Riders at end of ride: By finding the top ten stations that riders started with (See Start Station tab), I was able to see the flow of riders at the end of their ride to even go within lower to mid Manhattan. 
 * However, it looks like majority of these top stations start and end their ride within NJ stations. But dispersing within other area.

# Phenomenon 3: Check Phenom 3 Dashboard! <br>
* Popularity of ride within the top days and hour: In aggregate Peak office hours in the morning and night appear to be the most frequent use of bikes (by rider count)
  * Days:  Thurs,Tues, Monday seem to have the most hours ridden in total aggregate
  * Hours: 6-7 AM and 5-6 PM being the busiest in aggregate
* Member habits follow more of a work commute schedule with more hours and higher riders throughout the work week.
* Casual riders have a more variable timing with Thurs being the most hours rode

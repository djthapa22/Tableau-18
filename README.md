**Overview**
Within this module I used the ETL methods to clean data provided by NYC/NJ bike data and used tableau to create meaningful visualitions. <br>

# Phonomenon 1: <br>
* Member & Rider Type: The data suggests the NJ bike market has more member users,(<b>~50K</b>), than casual riders. Along with Classic bikes being the most popular amongst a choice of docked, electric and classic bikes. 
  * The member user also tends to ride more distance than casual users (33K miles Vs ~10K miles)
  * Therefore: New Jersey's primary customer target should be member riders.
